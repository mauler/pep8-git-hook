PEP8 Git Commit Hook
====================

This is a pre-commit hook for Git that checks the code to be committed
for Python PEP8 style compliance.  The hook will prevent the commit in
case style violations are detected.

## Installation:

### Automatic via installer (requires wget and sh)

Copy and paste this your console:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauler/pep8-git-hook/master/install.sh -O - | sh
```

### Step by Step (pip install, git clone, chmod...)
1. Install the pycodestyle (formally called pep8) program: ```$ pip install pycodestyle```
2. Save pre-commit as your_project/.git/hooks/pre-commit
3. Mark pre-commit executable: ```$ chmod +x your_project/.git/hooks/pre-commit```

## Usage
The hook can be overridden: ```$ git commit --no-verify```

Currently, the following PEP8 codes are checked for:

E111 indentation is not a multiple of four
E125 continuation line does not distinguish itself from next logical line
E203 whitespace before ':'
E261 at least two spaces before inline comment
E262 inline comment should start with '# '
E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
E303 too many blank lines (2)
E502 the backslash is redundant between brackets
E701 multiple statements on one line (colon)
E711 comparison to None should be 'if cond is None:'
W291 trailing whitespace
W293 blank line contains whitespace

In case you want to modify the list of codes to ignore, edit the
```ignore_codes``` list in the pre-commit file.
If you want to select only specific codes to scan for, use the
```select_codes``` list.
Additional arguments to the pycodestyle program (e.g., ```--max-line-length=120```) can be added to the ```overrides``` list.
